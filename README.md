As a online user I want to search through gifs so that I can share to my feed
As a web user I want to find the right gifs so that I can share my thoughts through gifs
As a social media user I want to find the right gifs so that I can post my feelings through gif



In this project, we are creating our own search engines through Giphy that will allow users to search a keyword in finding gif's related to the keyword. We first obtained our own API key through Giphy and then will create the search engine. Users will be able to type in their keyword, click the submit button, and the site will query the Giphy API.
This project will contain 3 files that will include: html, css, and js. 
idk if I can do flex but I'll try my best, also javascript is hard. I could do better. Also, finding a rare font.
